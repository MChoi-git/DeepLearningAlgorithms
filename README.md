# Description
Welcome! This repository is used to keep track of various important algorithms
in deep learning that I've implemented. More to come.

# Environments
Since every subfolder of DL topics can require a vastly different environment,
I've provided (singularity) container resources under the `containers` folder. 
There are also instructions on how to build each container remotely if needed,
else you can build directly from the `.def` files.
